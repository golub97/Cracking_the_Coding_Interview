This problem can be approached in three key steps:
1. Clear the bits j through i in N
2. Shift M so that it lines up with bits j through i
3. Merge Mand N. 

The trickiest part is Step 1. 
How do we clear the bits in N? 
We can do this with a mask. 
This mask will have all 1s, except for Os in the bits j through i. 
We create this mask by creating the left half of the mask first, and then the right half.

In a problem like this (and many bit manipulation problems), you should make sure to thoroughly test your code. 
It's extremely easy to wind up with off-by-one errors.
